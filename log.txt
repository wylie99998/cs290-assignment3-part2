Tasks: During this period I continued working on trying to parse the language of the 
GISTS and failed.  I was unable to figure out how to parse the JSON within the JSON without
an error.  I also finished the styling for the page and made significant progress on the
fetch list, and the favorite list local storage feature.

Tasks: During this period I worked on bugs in the favourites list and switched to using an array
rather than saving each gist separately in the local storage.
